# <p align='center'>Analysis of New York City Traffic Accidents (Jan 2020 - Aug 2023)</p>

## Overview:

## General Process
* I accessed the dataset from Maven Analytics free Dataset collection (NYC Traffic Accidents)
* Used SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to perform analysis and understand the dataset
* After having a better understanding of the dataset, I used Tableau to create visualizations/dashboards to visualize the findings.

## Description
The NYC Traffic Accidents table contains all motor vehicle collisions reported by NYPD from January 2021 to April 2023. Each row represents a single collision and includes details such as vehicles, victims involved, contributing factors (Speeding, Texting, etc), date, time, and location (borough, street name, latitude/longitude)
